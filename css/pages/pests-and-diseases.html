    <h2>Protecting Your Garden</h2>

      One of the biggest challenges in gardening is dealing with pests and plant diseases. Small insects like aphids, 
      whiteflies, and caterpillars can quickly damage plants by feeding on leaves. Diseases such as powdery mildew or 
      leaf spot can also spread fast if not addressed early.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prevention is always better than cure. Regularly inspect your plants, especially the underside of leaves, 
      where pests often hide. Remove infected leaves immediately to stop diseases from spreading. Good spacing 
      between plants also improves airflow, reducing fungal growth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many natural methods can be used for control. A spray made of mild soap and water works against aphids, while 
      introducing beneficial insects like ladybugs helps restore balance in the garden. By staying observant and 
      proactive, you can manage pests without relying on harmful chemicals.
