    <h2>Gardening in Small Spaces</h2>
    <img src="../images/container.jpg" alt="Plants growing in colorful pots on a balcony" style="max-width:100%; height:auto; margin:1rem 0;">
    <p>
      Container gardening is ideal for those with limited space. Even if you only have a balcony, terrace, or small patio, 
      you can still enjoy the benefits of growing plants. Containers allow you to move plants easily, giving them the 
      sunlight they need and protecting them from harsh conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The key to successful container gardening is choosing the right pots. Ensure they have drainage holes at the bottom 
      to prevent waterlogging. Use a high-quality potting mix instead of garden soil, as it is lighter and drains better. 
      Adding compost will also give plants the nutrients they need to thrive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Popular plants for containers include herbs like basil, mint, and parsley, as well as vegetables like cherry 
      tomatoes and peppers. Flowers such as marigolds and petunias also do well. Remember to water consistently, as 
      containers dry out faster than garden beds.
